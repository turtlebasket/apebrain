ApeBrain
===
ApeBrain is an extremely simple task scheduler project in which my stupid ass attempts to (re)learn C/C++, while attempting to actually something remotely useful in the process.

Features
---
- [x] `ncurses` interface with vim-style and arrow-key bindings
- [x] Simple task tracking
- [ ] storage using `std::vector`
- [ ] \[MAYBE\] `apebraind` daemon + due date tracking
