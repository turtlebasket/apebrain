ApeBrain
===
ApeBrain is a simple task scheduler project in which my stupid ass attempts to (re)learn C/C++, while actually creating something remotely useful.

Features
---
- [ ] simple task tracking
- [ ] `ncurses` interface with `vim` and arrow key bindings
- [ ] \[MAYBE\]`apebraind` daemon + due date tracking
